## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to use custom colors using psuedo-code, font properties, flex box, box-shadows etc .

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>HTML and CSS foundation</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  box-shadow: 1.5rem;
}
```


### Continued development

I earger to continue learnig more about Css properties such as variables, custom fonts and more HTML5 semantics for SEO eligibility.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me for styling the box-shadow. I really liked this pattern and simple way they implemented the style for easy learning. I will use it going forward.
